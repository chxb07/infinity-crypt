# CryptoVault üîí  

**A client-side encryption tool for secure data protection**  

## Features ‚ú®  

- Text Encryption/Decryption - Secure client-side operations  
- File Protection - Encrypt/decrypt files locally  
- Password Security - Hashed credentials with localStorage  
- Modern UI - Dark mode, animations, and responsive design  
- Zero Backend - 100% frontend JavaScript implementation  

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è  

1. Encrypt text with secret keys  
2. View operation history  
3. Decrypt anytime with your key  

## Security Note üîê  

This demo uses:  
- XOR encryption (for educational purposes)  
- Client-side password hashing  

 



**Educational Purpose**: This project demonstrates frontend cryptography concepts without server dependencies. Ideal for learning client-side security implementations.
